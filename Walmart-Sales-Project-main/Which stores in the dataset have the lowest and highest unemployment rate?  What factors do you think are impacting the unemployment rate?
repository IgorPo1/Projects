Store 23 has the lowest unemployment rate (4.796) while Store 12 has the highest (13.116).

The correlation matrix reveals a few potential factors that might be influencing the unemployment rate:

CPI (Consumer Price Index): There's a moderate negative correlation (-0.302) between Unemployment and CPI, suggesting that higher consumer prices might be associated with lower unemployment rates. 
This could be due to increased economic activity during periods of inflation.
Weekly_Sales: A weak negative correlation (-0.106) exists between Unemployment and Weekly_Sales, indicating that stores with higher sales might have slightly lower unemployment rates.
This could be because successful stores can afford to hire more employees.
Temperature: A weak positive correlation (0.101) is observed between Unemployment and Temperature, suggesting that warmer temperatures might be slightly associated with higher unemployment rates.
This could be due to seasonal employment fluctuations or other factors related to weather patterns.
Fuel_Price: The correlation between Unemployment and Fuel_Price is very weak (-0.035) and might not be significant.
It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis would be needed to determine the exact factors impacting the unemployment rate in these stores. 
Other factors not included in this dataset, such as local economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies, could also play a significant role.
