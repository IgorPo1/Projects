The correlation between CPI and Weekly_Sales is negative for both holiday and non-holiday weeks, indicating that higher consumer prices tend to be associated with lower weekly sales.

However, the correlation is stronger during holiday weeks (-0.151) compared to non-holiday weeks (-0.057).
This suggests that the negative impact of higher consumer prices on sales is more pronounced during holidays, possibly due to consumers being more price-sensitive during these periods or having other spending priorities.
