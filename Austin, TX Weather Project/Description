Description: In this project, I will analyze daily-aggregated weather data from Austin, Texas to draw conclusions and make future predictions about Austin’s climate.

Difficulty: Hard

Data download: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grubenm/austin-weather

SQL Practice: 
I will pretend this data was stored in a table in a SQL server.  The table is named austin_weather and it contains all of the fields I see in the dataset in 5-minute intervals.  The data begins on January 1, 1990 at 12:00am and ends on December 31, 2020 at 11:55pm.  What SQL code would I write to query all of the data contained in the provided dataset, aggregated exactly how it is in the provided dataset?

Business Questions:
1) Do I see any measurable changes in Austin’s climate (temperature, visibility, precipitation) throughout the period of the dataset? 
2) What do I think may have caused these changes?
3) Based on the data, what trends do I notice, and what predictions can I make for Austin’s climate in the future?
4) Do I notice any correlation between any of the fields in the dataset?  Can I use the observed correlation to make future predictions?
