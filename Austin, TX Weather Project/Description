SQL Practice: 
Pretend this data was stored in a table in a SQL server.  The table is named austin_weather and it contains all of the fields you see in the dataset in 5-minute intervals.  The data begins on January 1, 1990 at 12:00am and ends on December 31, 2020 at 11:55pm.  What SQL code would you write to query all of the data contained in the provided dataset, aggregated exactly how it is in the provided dataset?

Business Questions:
1) Do you see any measurable changes in Austin’s climate (temperature, visibility, precipitation) throughout the period of the dataset? 
2) What do you think may have caused these changes?
3) Based on the data, what trends do you notice, and what predictions can you make for Austin’s climate in the future?
4) Do you notice any correlation between any of the fields in the dataset?  Can we use the observed correlation to make future predictions?
